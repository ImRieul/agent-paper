Based on the information from the requirements, the objective is to analyze the impact of transformational and transactional leadership on employee job satisfaction in a specific mold enterprise. To achieve this, it's important to select suitable statistical methods for the analysis.

### Proposed Statistical Methods

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: To summarize the data regarding leadership styles and job satisfaction, including measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.

2. **Correlation Analysis**: To investigate the relationship between different leadership styles (transformational and transactional) and job satisfaction levels. Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients could be applicable depending on the data distribution.

3. **T-test Analysis**: If the data allows, a t-test could be used to compare job satisfaction levels between employees under transformational and transactional leadership to evaluate significant differences.

4. **Regression Analysis**: Multiple regression analysis could be employed to determine how well leadership styles predict job satisfaction.

5. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: If there are more than two groups to compare (e.g., if classification by leadership style has multiple levels), ANOVA can help in understanding the differences across groups.
